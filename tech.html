            <h2>
                Design
            </h2>
            <p>
                The 24-inch iMac is 11.5mm thick — about the same thickness as the original iPhone.
                It no longer has a prominent chin with an Apple logo, and gone are the thick black bezels surrounding the display.
                The 2021 iMac is a slim and light desktop PC with seven color options and powerful Apple Silicon.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Colors
            </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Blue</li>
                <li>Green</li>
                <li>Pink</li>
                <li>Silver</li>
                <li>Yellow</li>
                <li>Orange</li>
                <li>Purple</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The color design splits into two tones — a muted color on the front "chin" of the display and a more saturated color on the rear of the computer.
                The front has a slim white bezel surrounding the screen.
                The muted color and white bezel are used to maintain display color balance and reduce distractions.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Display and audio
            </h2>
            <p>
                Apple increased the resolution to match the size of the new display.
                Moving from 21.5 inches to 24 inches necessitated an increase from 4K to 4.5K to maintain Retina resolution.
                It is 4480 by 2520 pixels with a 218 PPI.
            </p>
            <p>The display is otherwise unchanged. It has 500 nits of brightness, a P3 wide color gamut, and True Tone technology.</p>
            <p>Apple says the new iMac supports spatial audio when playing video with Dolby Atmos. This means that all audio will sound like it's coming from a specific direction around you,
                and when you turn your head, you'll still perceive audio from the correct direction.</p>
            <h2>
                Performance
            </h2>
            <p>
                Apple claims that the performance gains provided by the M1 enable instant wake from sleep, faster app launch, and 85% faster CPU performance.
                Apps like Affinity Photo so run much more efficiently that users can edit large photos in real-time.

                Thanks to Rosetta 2 and macOS Big Sur, apps originally built for Intel Macs work seamlessly on the ARM platform.
                In some cases, Intel apps actually run better via translation on the M1 than they do on Intel Macs.
                Native ARM-based apps and translated Intel apps aren't the only software users can run either. Thanks to the M1, users can run iPhone and iPad apps natively on the iMac.

                There are two versions of the 24-inch iMac — a cheaper one with fewer ports and fewer color options and a more expensive one with slightly better performance.
                The M1 on the cheaper model has an 8-core CPU and a 7-core GPU and can be configured with up to 1TB of storage and 16GB of RAM. The more expensive model has an 8-core CPU and 8-core GPU and can be configured with 2TB of storage and 16GB of RAM.

                The 24-inch iMac scored 1729 on the single-core metric and 7459 on the multi-core metric. This was achieved with the base 8-core CPU and 7-core GPU M1 processor.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Ports and I/O
            </h2>
            <p>
                The ports included with the 24-inch iMac differ depending on which model customers choose.
                Both models have two USB 4/Thunderbolt ports, but only the more expensive model has two additional USB 3 ports.
                The magnetic power cable connects to an external power brick that also houses a Gigabit Ethernet port. Only the more expensive models come with an Ethernet port, however.

                There is a headphone jack on the left side of the iMac because there wasn't enough depth to place it in the back.
                A headphone jack needs 14mm of space, where the 24-inch iMac has only 11.5mm of depth.

                It has a 1080p webcam with special image processing performed by the M1. Apple says it is the best webcam ever placed in a Mac.

                Apple apparently considered placing Face ID in the redesigned M1 model since its display thickness would have enough space for the technology.
                However, the idea was scrapped before final production began for unknown reasons.

                A color-matched Magic Keyboard comes with both iMacs, but only the more expensive model has integrated Touch ID in the keyboard.
                Customers can upgrade their keyboard or add a color-matched Magic Mouse or Magic Trackpad at checkout.

                There is a three-mic array that Apple says provides studio-quality recordings.
                The beamforming mics ignore background noise so the audio heard on calls and in recordings is clear.
